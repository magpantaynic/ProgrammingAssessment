	Make a simple calculator that asks the user for their age. Then calculate the healthy heart rate range for that age, and display it.

	Their maximum heart rate should be 220 - their age.
	The target heart rate zone is the 50 - 85% of the maximum.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Output:

	What is your age? 50
	Your maximum heart rate should be 170 beats per minute
	Your target HR Zone is 85 - 145 beats per minute
